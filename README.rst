**Better Data = Better Outcomes.** 

**VerityPy &amp; VerityDotNet** libraries combine curated human expertise with Machine Learning (ML) 
into software components to accelerate development and signficantly lower the level of effort needed 
to make data ready for high quality Data Science, Machine Learning, and predictive models.

The libraries contain expert algorithms developed from in-depth investigations, forensic tracing, and specialized remediation on 
large data systems across many fields, always with successful outcomes. Our human experts discovered where to look, 
what to look for, and what to do about problems especially deeply buried ones missed by traditional tools. These were then tuned 
and tested on a variety of data sets to refine their performance and determine the characteristics and statistics most 
useful to enable faster and more accurate data processing.

The functions enable coding labor-intensive, complicated tasks to improve data quality, remediate errors, 
normalize data across sources, and enrich data for AI/ML, Data Science, scenario modeling, and database modernization.

Examples
-------------------------

These example source data files and VerityX result files are provided as-is as mere demonstrations of the 
type of errors that the libraries handle and which are usually beyond the functionality of traditional data tools. 
These source files can be used to compare different tools and coding methods to identify and characterize errors, 
anomalies, and actual versus documented data syntax and semantics.

**THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE, IMPLICT OR EXPLICIT, THAT THE DATA IS ACCURATE, USABLE IN YOUR 
DATA SYSTEMS, OR FREE FROM HARMFUL EFFECTS WHETHER UNINTENTIONAL OR INTENTIONAL. USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.**
