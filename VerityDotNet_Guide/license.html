Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Technik will provide to Company the Technik Software or Services described in each Order.</p>
<section id="technik-software-and-services">
<h3>1. Technik Software and Services<a class="headerlink" href="#technik-software-and-services" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>During the term of this Agreement, Technik grants to Company and Company accepts a non-exclusive, nontransferable, revocable and limited license to use each item of Technik Software listed on an Order by Company for Company’s own internal use (and not for resale in a materially unaltered form), subject to the terms, obligations, and restrictions set forth in the Order and in this Agreement (“Technik Software License”).</p>
<p>Each Technik Software License and each Service is subject to permissions, limitations and responsibilities stated in the applicable Order (“Metrics”), which may state whether Company is permitted to:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p>evaluate the Technik Software or use it in a production environment;</p></li>
<li><p>use the Technik Software at no charge or for a stated fee;</p></li>
<li><p>permit access to the Technik Software to an unlimited number of authorized users or to a limited number of authorized users;</p></li>
<li><p>install and use the Technik Software in one computing device (“Machine”) or multiple Machines;</p></li>
<li><p>use a single copy or multiple copies of the Technik Software (“Copies”);</p></li>
<li><p>use the Technik Software solely for internal development use (“Internal Use”);</p></li>
<li><p>combine the Technik Software with Company’s own software (“Company Software”);</p></li>
<li><p>distribute to one or more of Company’s customers (each, a “Customer”);</p></li>

<li><p>Developer License Perpetual. Grants the use of either (i) a specific Technik Software Product or (ii) the TechnikSuite by a single software developer in an organization at a single Location without an expiration. The Technik Software may be deployed within to any number of web applications, intranet applications, or desktop software applications. This license type does not allow distribution of the Technik Software to third parties, clients of the Company, or SaaS project usage scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p>Royalty-Free Redistribution Coverage. This add-on, which may be purchased under an Order, grants Company the right to distribute the Technik Software (without any duty to pay royalties) as part of a number of distinct packaged commercial or open-source products to third parties, in accordance with the number of projects covered in the base license (“Royalty-Free Redistribution Coverage”). Grants the use of the Technik Software to deploy within SaaS software services, in accordance with the number of projects covered in the base license.</p></li>
<li><p>Company may subscribe separately to Support and Updates, which Technik may modify in it its sole discretion, on either a 1-year or multi-year basis. Then-current pricing for Support and Updates is set forth in an Order.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlimited Enterprise License. This license includes Royalty-Free Redistribution Coverage. The Unlimited Enterprise License is perpetual, subject to Company’s compliance with the License Agreement (“Unlimited Enterprise License”).

The Unlimited Monthly License permits the use on a subscription basis by an unlimited number of developers in an organization in an unlimited number of Locations to deploy the TechnikSuite within an unlimited number of web applications, intranet applications, or desktop software applications (“Unlimited Monthly License”).</p></li>
<li><p>All Licenses are non-transferable and sharing of licenses outside an organization or agency/client relationship is prohibited. Licenses expressly exclude any rights not specifically granted under the Agreement, and expressly exclude, without limitation, OEM redistribution, and using the Technik Software as SaaS, without additional purchase of Royalty-Free Distribution Coverage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the type of Technik Software License, Technik and Company expressly agree that Company will not directly compete with the functionality of any current Technik Software or Service.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Company may not redistribute, republish, or otherwise make available the Technik Software or Services to any third party without the prior written consent of Technik as stated in an Order or this Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>Company will monitor its own use of the Technik Software and report any use in excess of the Metrics and volume. Technik Software may monitor use to verify with Technik servers compliance with Metrics, volume, and the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Company or end-user data is ever transmitted to Technik servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusion of Technik Software in a package must include this license in its entirety or a statement of this license and a link to its full text on the Technik website</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusion of Technik Software in a package must include a statement of Technik’s copyright for the components of the package from Technik</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusion of Technik Software with open source software or made into a new work distributed as open source software will not amend the non-open source license of Technik Software which must be stated explicitly in the new work’s license or notice.</p></li>

<section id="confidentiality">
<h3>5. Confidentiality<a class="headerlink" href="#confidentiality" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall mean non-public information and data received by either party (“receiving party”) from the other party (“disclosing party”).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, information and data shall not be deemed to be Confidential Information if such information or data: (i) was known by the receiving party at the time of such disclosure; (ii) was known to the general public at the time of such disclosure or becomes known to the general public (other than by act of the receiving party) subsequent to such disclosure; (iii) is disclosed lawfully to the receiving party by a third party without restriction; (iv) is developed independently by the receiving party without reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or (v) is approved in writing by the disclosing party for disclosure by the receiving party.</p>
<p>The receiving party may disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information when the receiving party is required by law (e.g., by subpoena), provided however the receiving party will give the disclosing party prior written notice of such required disclosure (unless notifying the disclosing party is prohibited by law), and will work with the disclosing party to limit the required disclosure or have the requirement revoked (e.g., a court revokes a subpoena for the Confidential Information).</p>
<p>The receiving hereunder shall not disclose to any third-party firm, corporation, individual, or other entity, any Confidential Information which it receives from the disclosing party. For clarity, Technik may disclose the Company’s Confidential Information to Technik’s employees and independent contractors in connection with providing the Technik Software and performing the Services hereunder. The receiving party shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as the receiving party uses for its own confidential and proprietary information, but in no event less than a standard of reasonable care.</p>

<h3>6. Term and Termination<a class="headerlink" href="#term-and-termination" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>For each item of Technik Software and each Service, the initial term will be stated in the Order, and may renew for additional periods stated as Renewal Terms on the Order. If no Initial Term is specified on the Order, then the Initial Term will be one year from the Effective Date.

<p>This Agreement may be terminated by either party for material breach by the other party provided that the terminating party gives thirty (30) days prior written notice specifying the breach, and the breaching party fails to cure or correct the breach within the thirty-day notice period. In the event of any such termination, Company shall pay Technik for all Technik Software provided and for all Services performed by Technik and for all  work-in-progress up to the date of termination.</p>
<p>Company may terminate an Unlimited Monthly License upon thirty (30) days written notice prior to the start of the next month of the subscription term. Upon Technik’s receipt of a termination notice by Company, the Unlimited Monthly License subscription shall terminate either when the maximum API calls permitted under the Order have been made or the end of the month in which such termination was effective.</p>
<p>This Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically terminated upon any material breach of Company’s obligations under Sections 1 (Technik Software and Services), 3 (Financial), 4 (Intellectual Property), or 5 (Confidentiality).</p>
<p>Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Company shall immediately return to Technik any Technik Software, related materials, and all copies thereof or, with Technik’s prior written permission, Company shall destroy all such materials and certify in writing as to their destruction.</p>
