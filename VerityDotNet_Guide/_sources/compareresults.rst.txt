==============================
Compare Results in Jupyter
==============================

Make Jupyter Notebook comparing and assessing data before and after VerityDotNet processing.

.. contents:: 
    :depth: 2


Goal
===============

Use the stored files from Normalize & Enrich guide to showcase how VerityDotNet 
makes high quality data with low effort and straightforward design from source data 
with multiple different types of errors inclusing some so severe they cannot be 
handled with most data tools. 


Objectives
============

    * Use Jupyter Notebook to make report with charts and comments
    * Read stored data files from as-is, remediated, and final data sets
    * Read stored JSON files from as-is, remediated, and final VerityDotNet QualityAnalysis objects
    * Compare errors among three versions
    * Describe improvements going from as-is to remediated to final
    * Show enrichment fields in final set and how they can be used in downstream analytics and modeling

Jupyter Notebook
===================

See example Jupyter file 'VerityPy_compare.ipynb' at the Techniks Interlytics support web site. This is the same 
Jupyter file used to compare results from the VerityPy library. Since both VerityPy and VerityDotNet save results in  
similar schemas only the file references need to change within the Jupyter file. Small variations in the schemas are 
handled by the VerityPy library used in the Jupyter code.

A link to HTML version of charts and tables is:

See `Jupyter Report <_static/VerityPy_compare_DotNet.html>`_ 

The overview in this report shows a table listing errors discovered and a chart of the 
before and after Field Quality metric.
