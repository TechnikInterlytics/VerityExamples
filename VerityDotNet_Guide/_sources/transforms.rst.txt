Transforms

**VerityDotNet** transforms allow remediating and enriching source data into Normalized data with 
a higher level of quality, accuracy, and meaning to support demanding use cases. There are five 
kinds of transforms:

   1. Assignment: assigns values to field as a fixed value, reference to another field in record, random number, list of categories via frequencies, lookup dictionaries
   2. Conditional: conditional tests of equality and inequality for numeric, string, and date values
   3. Numeric: numeric calculation functions including using other fields in record by reference
   4. Text: manipulate with slicing, adding, padding, replacing
   5. Date: Change date format to ISO 8601 including from special Excel format 

Transforms are objects with a list of child Op objects. These are described in the "objects" page. Each Op has properties for parameter settings titled 
param1, param2, param3. Their use and appropriate values are specific to each transform function which are described in this page.

Assignment
===========

noOp
-----

No operation. Use to stop operations in conditional sequence


setToValue
-----------

Assign a fixed value

    * Param1: Value to assign. Required


setToIndex
-----------

Assign a fixed value equal to the record's index in output set which is supplied by application code to the transform execution module.

    * Param1: Optional integer starting index which must be greater than or equal to 0. Default is 0.


setToRef
-----------

Assigns the value of a referenced source field in the current record

    * Param1: field title to get its current value to assign. Required


setToRandom
-----------

Uses random number generator to produce a value scaled between the minimum and maximum values

    * Param1: optional as minimum. Default is 0
    * Param2: optional as maximum. Default is 1. If this is \< min then set to min + 1


setToFrequencyList
-------------------

Applies a value from a list using relative frequencies of occurrence

    * Param1: relative frequencies of occurrence. Can use any real \> 0 and will be scaled 
      to sum. Since list, enter delimited by pipe such as 2|7|.5|9 where the second list item occurs 37.8% percent (7/18.5) of the time.
    * Param2: list of values correlated to Param1 frequencies and entered with pipe delimiter like red|green|blue|orange
    * Param3: Optional. If used, either a reference field title to use as source of base value, or a real number 0.0-1.0 . 
      Otherwise, the default is to use a random number.


lookup
--------

Assigns a value from a lookup list based on matching values to keys where keys can use wildcards. 
The match can be made to one, two, or three source fields in the record with field 1 always 
the current value while fields 2 and 3 are optional if set in Param2. 
Leave Param2 empty to use only 1 field as the match value. All selected fields must match their 
respective conditions for a lookup result to be assigned. 
The lookup dictionary has records each with properties: key1, key2, key3, value 
depending on how many keys are used which is set by Param1 and Param2. 
Keys can use front and/or back wildcard (*) like top*, *night, *state* to allow token matching. 

    * Param1: title of list that has been pre-loaded into array of lists as part of initialization. Required.
    * Param2: Optional. Field 2 title, or fields 2 and 3 titles. If both supplied use pipe to delimit such as 'field2|field3'.

Examples
==============


Populate Enrichment Field
-------------------------------

Enrichment fields are key to improving and maintaining data accuracy, trust, integrity and pedigree for 
any use case needing managed control of data assets and which has a strong dependency of outcomes 
on even small quantities of data errors and variability. They are fields added to the output data 
set that are not in the source data. Essentially, they are in-record metadata. 

In this example, we have an enrichment field titled 'useAGI' that is defined to be a boolean datatype 
indicating whether the output record should be used for aggregating records into groups with subtotals 
of their field 'AGI' values. This is real-world data from the IRS Migration data set where AGI is the 
Adjusted Gross Income from tax returns. The problem is there are records in the source data that cannot be 
used for subtotal calculations because they are either already subtotals or have faulty data. There are 
two ways to detect these situations based on IRS documentation:

    1. faulty data: AGI will have value = -1
    2. is a subtotal: field 'y1_state_name' contains words ["total","non-","migrants","Migration","Foreign","-US","Same State"]. 
       Of these, the most consistent is the word part 'migra' when case insensitive

These data characteristics were discovered using **VerityDotNet** analysis function and reviewing the 
errors (e.g. the words noted are not correct state names, and -1 is not a valid AGI value from real tax returns) 
and unique value distributions.

While this business logic may seem complicated, it is easily represented in **VerityDotNet** transforms 
in the following steps:

    1. setToRef("AGI")
    2. ifNotEq("-1")
    3. setToValue("false")
    4. setToRef("y1_state_name")
    5. ifStrContains("migra")
    6. setToValue("true")
    7. setToValue("false")

The action flow of this transform depends on the values of the fields 'AGI' and 'y1_state_name' 
in the record being processed. Consider three situations:

    * AGI = -1, y1_state_name= 'AL' : 
      Step 1 assigns -1 to the working value. Step 2 tests if the value 
      is NOT equal to -1 since IF conditions flow as IF --> action when false then stop else action when true then continue. 
      In this case, the IF condition is FALSE since the value is -1 meaning NOT EQUAL is FALSE. Thus, 
      step 3 is executed assigning 'false' as the final value and the transform ends.
    * AGI = 5400, y1_state_name = 'AL Total Migration-US and Foreign' : 
      Step 1 assigns 5400 to the working value. Step 2 tests if the value 
      is NOT equal to -1. In this case, the IF condition is TRUE since the value is not -1. 
      Thus, step 3 is ignored and step 4 assigns 'AL Total Migration-US and Foreign' as the working value. 
      Step 5 tests if the working value contains 'migra' case insensitive (since that is default for function) 
      with this result being TRUE. Consequently, step 6 is ignored (since it is for FALSE result from IF) 
      and step 7 is executed assigning final value 'false'. Note that if step 5 was instead 
      ifStrContains("migra","true") making it case sensitive then its result would be FALSE and 
      step 6 executed assigning final value of 'true'.
    * AGI = 5400, y1_state_name = 'AL' : 
      Step 1 assigns 5400 to the working value. Step 2 tests if the value 
      is NOT equal to -1. In this case, the IF condition is TRUE since the value is not -1. 
      Thus, step 3 is ignored and step 4 assigns 'AL' as the working value. 
      Step 5 tests if the working value contains 'migra' case insensitive (since that is default for function) 
      with this result being FALSE. Consequently, step 6 executed assigning final value of 'true'.

Correct Numeric Units
---------------------------

In this example, we again use real-world data from the IRS Migration data set where AGI is the 
Adjusted Gross Income from tax returns in thousands of US dollars. We want to transform the 
value into actual dollars to support downstream analytics. 
The problem is there are records in the source data that cannot be 
used for subtotal calculations because they are faulty data. These are 
denoted by AGI = -1.

We use business logic to multiply by 1000 unless the AGI is faulty in the following steps:

    1. setToRef("AGI")
    2. ifNotEq("-1")
    3. noOp()
    4. mult("1000")

The action flow of this transform depends on the value of the field 'AGI'.

    * AGI = -1: 
      Step 1 assigns -1 to the working value. Step 2 tests if the value 
      is NOT equal to -1 since IF conditions flow as IF --> action when false then stop else action when true then continue. 
      In this case, the IF condition is FALSE since the value is -1 meaning NOT EQUAL is FALSE. Thus, 
      step 3 is executed which is the special noOp function (no operation meaning do nothing) and the transform ends.
    * AGI = 123.45: 
      Step 1 assigns 123.45 to the working value. Step 2 tests if the value 
      is NOT equal to -1 which is TRUE.
      In this case, step 3 is ignored and step 4 is executed multiplying the working value by 1000 and 
      assigning this as final value.
