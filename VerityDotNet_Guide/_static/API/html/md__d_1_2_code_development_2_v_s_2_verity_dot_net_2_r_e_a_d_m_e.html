Overview</h1>
<p><b><a class="el" href="namespace_verity_dot_net.html">VerityDotNet</a></b> is a DotNet (6.0) library by Technik Interlytics for Better Data = Better AI. Automate labor-intensive, complex tasks to improve quality, remediate errors, and enrich data sets using combined curated human expertise with Machine Learning. It is a Data Inspector, Remediator, Normalizer on large structured data sets. It combines curated human expert knowledge gained from in-depth forensic analysis and remediating data in many fields, with Machine Learning pattern extraction results to know where to look, what to look for, and what to do about problems found lurking deep within huge data sets. It automates many of the labor-intensive, difficult, highly-detailed tasks to improve data quality, remediate errors, and enrich data sets with in-record annotations for ML, Data Science, analytics, forensics, auditing, and warehousing.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
Structured Data Functions</h1>
<p>There are two main types of functions provided on structured data sets:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Analyzing: inspects data records for structural and value consistency, anomalies, errors especially deeply buried problems that may only occur in a few records within millions but enough to cause significant bias, discrepancies, and failed validations. Our human experts have discovered many problems common in data systems across business and technical fields that are either not detected or cannot be remediated with standard DataOps. Some examples:<ul>
<li>data variations (types, formats, encoding) from import/export in different systems especially spreadsheets and legacy mainframes</li>
<li>special characters not visible to users causing downstream problems</li>
<li>small number of anomalies buried within very large data sets overwhelming tools</li>
<li>mismatched joint field values such as geographic location codes and names</li>
<li>long strings of digits used as codes (e.g. accounting, ERP) cast into number format stripping digits thereby corrupting codes</li>
<li>records broken into multiple lines causing fields to be misaligned, partial records, and incorrect values</li>
<li>open source data with embedded information-only records (e.g. IRS USA Migration demographics, Covid disease census) unknown to users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Normalizing &amp; Enriching: this encompasses everything necessary to get data records accurate for structure (field positions, data types, formats), values (numeric ranges, codes, lists of allowed values), and enrichment (added metadata fields for forensics, training models, analytics). Our human experts have worked extensively in the entire lifecycle of data in multiple fields allowing them to see and understand how and where data can become infected with problems and both the indicators of these problems and how to correct and annotate them to pass scrutiny by human and computer QC. Some examples are:<ul>
<li>rebuilding records broken into multiple lines</li>
<li>adding enrichment fields to annotate pedigree, trust, privacy, increased granularity with conditional logic and controlled vocabulary</li>
<li>several levels of conditional testing of multiple fields within single records to correctly encode/decode, transform field values</li>
<li>allowing multiple versions of lookup decoding per field based on other field indicators (e.g. time varying encoding schemes)</li>
<li>identifying when long values of numeric digits are strings or numbers and handling accordingly</li>
<li>lookup dictionary replacements using 1 or multiple fields as well as wildcard tokens and both boolean AND and NOT conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

Why Use <b>VerityDotNet</b></h1>
<p>It was created to solve the need to not just make data accurate, but also provide high visibility into how and why it was handled with transforms and codings such that it can be managed like other key business assets with oversight and collaborative review. All too often, the actual manipulation of data is handled by proficient engineers but the people who most need to review, understand, and adjust what is done are unable to decipher the complicated code, scripts, and technical documentation. Our human experts witnessed this situation in many clients and had to solve this challenge before the technical results would be accepted. Doing so led us to develop new data processing and reporting approaches that jointly handled complicated data engineering requirements along with visible and easy to understand business reporting. <b><a class="el" href="namespace_verity_dot_net.html">VerityDotNet</a></b> was created to provide this capability to a wide community with the following key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>easily reuse and adjust processing parameters for multiple iterations of transforms, codings, rules with reviews of results in end-use applications</li>
<li>review data processing steps and intermediate results throughout the entire process (i.e. no black boxes)</li>
<li>use processing commands that can be reviewed by business and technical people at both staff and manager levels</li>
<li>enable drop-in reporting with summary and detailed charts and tables of data actions, discoveries, and results</li>
<li>provide multiple views of data before and after to maximize understanding and discovery among all user types</li>
</ul>

What <b>VerityDotNet</b> Does</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
Analysis</h2>
<p><b><a class="el" href="namespace_verity_dot_net.html">VerityDotNet</a></b> analyzes structured source data and generates a thorough assessment of each field's actual value space for data types, formats, ranges, special characters, unique values and even coValues which are joint field (2 or 3) value distributions. This is a quick way to both profile source data, extract its schema, and discover anomalies that can be overlooked by other tools or missed by manual Quality Control reviews. A comprehensive report is returned in an object that can be used in further processing to make tables and charts such as in Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>Results are coordinated in class 'QualityAnalysis' allowing concise handling of the setup parameters and the breadth and depth of discovered characteristics and known/suspected errors. These results include:</p>
<ul>
<li>field unique values: per field unique values with count of instances.</li>
<li>field datatype distributions: each field has counts for detected datatypes (int, real, bool, date, string, empty).</li>
<li>field quality: each field is assigned a quality factor 0-100 based on discovered characteristics and knowledge-based algorithms.</li>
<li>record size distribution: record sizes (byte lengths) to count of instances.</li>
<li>record parsing errors: parsing errors (number fields after parsing relative to defined fields) by small1 (1 too few fields), small2 (2 or more missing fields), big (1 or more too many fields). Also, has example records.</li>
<li>record parsing distribution: number of parsed fields to count of instances.</li>
<li>special character distribution: special characters and their count of instances, as well as example records.</li>
<li>coValues: field combinations (2 or 3) unique value information.</li>
<li>error statistics: values such as number records with any kind of error, number records with datatype error, number records with format error and more</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Normalize &amp; Enrich</h2>
<p><b><a class="el" href="namespace_verity_dot_net.html">VerityDotNet</a>'s</b> transforms allow remediating and enriching source data into Normalized data with a higher level of quality, accuracy, and meaning to support demanding use cases. There are five kinds of transforms (see transforms page for details):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Assignment: assigns values to field as a fixed value, reference to another field in record, random number, list of categories via frequencies, lookup dictionaries</li>
<li>Conditional: conditional tests of equality and inequality for numeric, string, and date values</li>
<li>Numeric: numeric calculation functions including using other fields in record by reference</li>
<li>Text: manipulate with slicing, adding, padding, replacing</li>
<li>Date: Change date format to ISO 8601 including from special Excel format</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an example of a transform to populate an enrichment field 'useAGI' that denotes whether the record should be used in analytics based on the value of a numeric source field 'AGI'.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>setToRef("AGI")</li>
<li>ifEq("-1")</li>
<li>setToValue("true")</li>
<li>setToValue("false")</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to allow chaining of conditional functions, the flow is condition -&gt; [false action] else [true action]. Thus, if step 2 above is False then step 3 is done and the chain stops, whereas if step 2 is True then step 3 is skipped and step 4 is done (and any steps after it if they existed). The net result is this simple transform fills an enrichment field with boolean value enabling easy filtering downstream in a spreadsheet, database, or analytics dashboard.</p>
<p>A slightly more complicated logic flow that includes fixing formatting is the following transform that uses a source field 'y2_statefips' containing a 2 character code to lookup the corresponding title in an external lookup dictionary and then assigns that to an enrichment field 'DestStateName' since the original source data only had the code making it non-intuitive for users to understand the data records.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>setToRef("y2_statefips")</li>
<li>setLength("2","left","0")</li>
<li>lookup("StateName")</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1 gets the value of the field 'y2_statefips' from the current record. Step 2 fixes the string length to 2 characters with changes made to the left side of the string if it is too long (characters cut from left) or too short (characters added to left) with the character to add set to be '0' (zero). This is critical for code lookups since a very common problem when data is moved among systems is for leading zeros to be removed thereby changing a code like '01' into '1' which would not be found in the lookup. This ensures that such an error is fixed prior to doing the lookup which occurs in step 3 to a dictionary name 'StateName' (loaded during the setup phase of the job).</p>
